The statistical analysis began with descriptive profiling of the 120-participant sample. Key variables—age, gender, weekday/weekend screen-use hours, and Digital Eye Strain (DES) scores—were summarised. Normality was assessed (visual inspection and formal tests as appropriate), so means ± SD were reported for roughly symmetric variables, while medians (IQR) were used for skewed data.
Independent-samples t-tests compared mean DES scores between participants with and without Dry Eye Disease (DED), between females and males, and—exploratorily—between the single contact-lens user and non-users. Equal (or large) group sizes rendered the t-test robust; therefore, a Mann-Whitney U test was not necessary.
To examine behavioural drivers, Spearman rank correlations were computed between DES scores and weekday/weekend screen time within each DED stratum, a distribution-free choice suited to skewed usage data. Predictors with more than two levels (age bands, screen-time tiers, ophthalmic-symptom groups) were evaluated using one-way ANOVAs.
Finally, a multiple linear regression model (predictors: DED status, age, weekday screen time) quantified each factor’s unique contribution. Residual diagnostics (Shapiro–Wilk; Breusch–Pagan) indicated non-normality and heteroscedasticity, so coefficients were interpreted cautiously. Stratified regressions within DED and non-DED subgroups confirmed the stability of findings.
This sequential strategy—from descriptive profiling through targeted bivariate tests to an assumption-checked multivariable model—provided a comprehensive and assumption-aware evaluation of factors influencing DES severity.
